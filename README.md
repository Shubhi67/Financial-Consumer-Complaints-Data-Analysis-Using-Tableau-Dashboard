ABOUT PROJECT:

Developed Financial Consumer Complaints Dashboard which tracks all complaints and analyses trends in all categories. It's a Business ready Dashboard that allows employees to make data-driven decisions by evaluating each KPI Metric. The Inspiration for this dashboard is taken from Gandes Goldestan. It is a dynamic dashboard, where any user able to select date range at the top right of dashboard and can see the magic of map and chart.
